      I’m 18 years old and currently attending Codestack Academy. I’m a Hispanic
      American who lived in Livermore, California, for 15 years before moving to
      Tracy, where I’ve been for almost 3 years now. I was born into a Christian
      household and plan to continue growing my faith—not just for my family,
      but for myself as well.
      <br />
      Some of my favorite hobbies are playing guitar and bass, and cutting hair,
      which I hope to make part of my future career. These days, I spend most of
      my time at home working on assignments or relaxing by watching videos or
      playing video games. On Fridays, I like to go out and play basketball.
      Nothing too crazy—just a calm, simple lifestyle.
    </p>
